# Write a code that calculates the sum of those numbers from 30 to 420 which are multiples of 8 that means those numbers come in the table of 8.




# sum=0
# i=30
# while i<=420:
#     if i%8==0:
#         sum=sum+i
#     i=i+1
# print(sum)




i=30
while i<=420:
    if i%8==0:
        print(i)
    i=i+1
