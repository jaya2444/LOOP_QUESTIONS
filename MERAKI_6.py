# Question 1

# Make a program that prints all those numbers from 1 to 100 which are divisible by 7.

# The loop that you will write will start from 556.

# Your output should be as follows.

# 7
# 14
# 21
# 28
# 35
# 42
# 49
# 56
# 63
# 70
# 77
# 84
# 91
# 98



i=556
while i<=656:
    n=i-555
    if n%7==0:
        print(n)
    i=i+1
